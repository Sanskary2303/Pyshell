# Pyshell

## Overview

This project is a simple custom shell implemented in Python. It can execute basic built-in commands such as `exit`, `echo`, `type`, `pwd`, and `cd`, as well as external commands available in the system's `PATH`.

This project is just made for fun and I will be adding more features to it in the future.

## Features

1. **Built-in Commands**:
   - **`exit`**: Exits the shell.
   - **`echo`**: Prints the provided arguments to the terminal.
   - **`type`**: Displays information about command types (built-in or external).
   - **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.
   - **`cd`**: Changes the current working directory.

2. **External Commands**:
   - Executes external commands available in the system's `PATH`.

3. **Executable Scripts**:
   - The shell can execute executable scripts and files.

## Usage

### Running the Shell
